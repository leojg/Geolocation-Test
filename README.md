Just a test with html5 geolocation

If you want to try it: http://leojg.alwaysdata.net/geoloc

NOTE: If you are in Uruguay and using a pc or a laptop, for reasons beyond my control it migth be posible that your 
location be very inacurate becouse google locates these devices using nearby wifi routers, but, google needs 
to map all the routers to do this, and it haven't done such in Uruguay, and maybe in some other countries
(at least at the moment i am writing this), so it always locates you in Montevideo even if you are in other point of the
country.

If you are using a Smartphone, it should not be anyproblem.

Thanks for using this ^^
